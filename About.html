					All about Myself When I hike a mountain
				</h1>
				<p class="text container text-justify"> Spending time in nature to slow down and disconnect has become a fundamental part of my life. Nature gives evidence to the precision and creative hand of God. Hiking typically will bring you to places close to nature. I like being disconnected from my phone, screens, push notifications and just focus on the absolute basic needs of being a human: walking and eating.   In the city, we can rush through our days with blinders on, not paying attention, lost in our own world. I feel cranky when I have not had some outdoor time, even if that just means a walk around my neighborhood park in the city. Nature has so many lessons to teach us. Each time I go for a hike, I am reminded of how small I am compared to this earth. I have had numerous experiences that have resulted to who I am today. Many of these experiences are small and may seem insignificant to others, but they mean so much for me. For some experiences, the impact has been small and comes only in small doses. However, for other experiences such as the mountain hike I will talk about herein, the impact has been huge and completely life changing. Through this perspective, I find it easy to conclude that my life is a summation of all the experiences I have had. One step at a time, like a staircase, my life has been built and I attribute it all to how I have reacted to the different experiences I have had. Hiking gives me such great pleasure, because I am one with nature. To me, it is exhilarating, just seeing the water, the mountains, the different trees, flowers and animals. Additionally, meeting and talking to fellow hikers is always interesting. Seeing the beauty of the vistas is an amazing benefit. Hiking a mountain gives me great satisfaction of reaching the summit. The exercise itself is very satisfying. Hiking in nature gives me tremendous joy. Hiking makes me feel more alive. It is not about the highest peak or the hardest hike. It is about being immersed in nature and seeing the value in the peacefulness of it all. Through hiking, you can learn to love your own strength and that you will persevere through anything.  
				</p>
				<p class="text container text-justify">One thing I have realized is that I have a stronger connection with the friends I go hiking with. It feels like we talk about things you do not always talk about in the city, or you do not think about because you are in such a headspace thinking about other things. On a hike, you can just let go and open more. Being able to spend a full day on the trail with someone strengthens our relationship. I get to know them deeper. Hiking makes me feel adventurous. In the city, I am more serious and focused on getting things done – when I am in nature, I am more into cracking jokes and having a good time.</p>

					WHY CODING ? I think coding is one of the reason why my head is always hurting. I dont have enough sleep and im always feel sleepy. But i love it and i think i can enhanced my skill in time.

					If you pay any attention to tech, you’ve undoubtedly heard the terms coding and programming dozens of times. Many of the best tech careers require the ability to code.

					If you want to work in a high-paying field like software engineering, web development, or data science, understanding and using code is essential.
